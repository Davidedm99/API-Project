# API Project 09 2021
This the project for the teaching of "Algoritmi e Principi dell'Informatica" at Politecnico di Milano.
The project consists in a program that calcukates the minimum path from a point to another. For each row there is a value that expresses the cost of that specific route, the sum of these values calculated for each column and row gives us the cost of a path.
The program takes as input a number that defines the dimension of the Matrix containing all the costs of each route.
The implemented algorithm is a simple Dijkstra with some assumptions to speed up the whole thing.
A lot of improvements could be done, starting from the Global variables up to the management of the linked list, still I was able to get the maximum vote of 30 CUM LAUDE.
